            Statement of Faith
          </h3>
          <p className="mt-4 text-xl">
            Samaritan’s Purse bases its ministry on the following statement of
            faith:
          </p>

          <p className="pl-8">
            1. We believe the Bible to be the inspired, the only infallible,
            authoritative Word of God revealing the love of God to the world. 1
            Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:15-17; John 3:16. <br />
            <br />
            2. We believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three
            persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Matthew 28:19; John 10:30;
            Ephesians 4:4-6. <br />
            <br />
            3. We believe in the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin
            birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and
            atoning death through His shed blood on the cross, in His bodily
            resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and
            in His personal return in power and glory. Matthew 1:23; John 1:1-4
            and 1:29; Acts 1:11 and 2:22-24; Romans 8:34; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4;
            2 Corinthians 5:21; Philippians 2:5-11; Hebrews 1:1-4 and 4:15.{" "}
            <br />
            <br />
            4. We believe that all men everywhere are lost and face the judgment
            of God, that Jesus Christ is the only way of salvation, and that for
            the salvation of lost and sinful man, repentance of sin and faith in
            Jesus Christ results in regeneration by the Holy Spirit.
            Furthermore, we believe that God will reward the righteous with
            eternal life in heaven, and that He will banish the unrighteous to
            everlasting punishment in hell. Luke 24:46-47; John 14:6; Acts 4:12;
            Romans 3:23; 2 Corinthians 5:10-11; Ephesians 1:7 and 2:8-9; Titus
            3:4-7. <br />
            <br />
            5. We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, whose
            indwelling enables the Christian to live a godly life. John 3:5-8;
            Acts 1:8 and 4:31; Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 2:14; Galatians
            5:16-18; Ephesians 6:12; Colossians 2:6-10. <br />
            <br />
            6. We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost;
            the saved unto the resurrection of eternal life and the lost unto
            the resurrection of damnation and eternal punishment. 1 Corinthians
            15:51-57; Revelation 20:11-15. <br />
            <br />
            7. We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in the Lord Jesus
            Christ and that all true believers are members of His body, the
            Church. 1 Corinthians 12:12, 27; Ephesians 1:22-23. <br />
            <br />
            8. We believe that the ministry of evangelism (sharing and
            proclaiming the message of salvation only possible by grace through
            faith in Jesus Christ) and discipleship (helping followers of Christ
            grow up into maturity in Christ) is a responsibility of all
            followers of Jesus Christ. Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 1:8; Romans
            10:9-15; 1 Peter 3:15. <br />
            <br />
            9. We believe God’s plan for human sexuality is to be expressed only
            within the context of marriage, that God created man and woman as
            unique biological persons made for each other. God instituted
            monogamous marriage between male and female as the foundation of the
            family and the basic structure of human society. For this reason, we
            believe that marriage is exclusively the union of one genetic male
            and one genetic female. Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:5-6; Mark 10:6-9;
            Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9. <br />
            <br />
            10. We believe that we must dedicate ourselves to prayer, to the
            service of our Lord, to His authority over our lives, and to the
            ministry of evangelism. Matthew 9:35-38; 22:37-39, and 28:18-20;
            Acts 1:8; Romans 10:9-15 and 12:20-21; Galatians 6:10; Colossians
            2:6-10; 1 Peter 3:15. <br />
            <br />
            11. We believe that human life is sacred from conception to its
            natural end; and that we must have concern for the physical and
            spiritual needs of our fellowmen. Psalm 139:13; Isaiah 49:1;
            Jeremiah 1:5; Matthew 22:37-39; Romans 12:20-21; Galatians 6:10{" "}
            <br />
            <br />
            12. We believe that God wonderfully and immutably creates each
            person biological male or female. These two distinct but
            complementary sexes together reflect the image and likeness of God.
            Rejection of one’s biological sex is a rejection of God’s merciful
            design and creative order. Genesis 1:26-27;1 Corinthians 6:9;
            Deuteronomy 22:5
